  <h3>Video Game Designer, Praticle Maker, Programmer</h3>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I'm a student that is currently attending Sno-Isle for their Video Game Design program so I can learn more about how games are made and the process that people go through in order to make these games.
  I enjoy learning the game engines that create these projects and allowing them to thrive in the video game world for people to play and enjoy.
  Currently coding in C# and hoping to code in more languages as I continue and I am a big fan of Unity's Particle System (although it can be a tad janky at times).
  I'm looking forward to see what else I can do in the future and hope that people will support me in my future endeavors!</p>
  <p>P.S. I'm also going to break your kneecaps :D</p>
